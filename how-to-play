Yahtzee Text Game Guide
A guide for the “3-dice Yahtzee except with 5 dice” text game.
How to play the game:
This game of Yahtzee merges together elements of chance and strategy in order to give an engaging, yet unpredictable game. As the player, your only goal is to gain as much points as possible. In addition to this, due to command prompt clearing, it is also a MEMORY GAME.
Roll table 
Roll number 1 out of 3
dice num:   1  2  3  4  5
dice roll: [3, 1, 5, 4, 1]
dice lock: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

In this step, you have the option to lock any dice, meaning they won’t be rolled in the next roll.
To lock a dice, you enter the dice num of a dice you wish to lock.
In this example, if you want to lock the dice with a value of 5, you enter ‘3’ as the ‘dice num’ is 3.
If you do so, the dice with a value of 5 will not change.

Just like Boolean, in dice lock, false = 0 and true = 1.
However, when the game mechanic ‘non-unlockable dice amount’ is adjusted, a dice lock value may equal 2. This means that throughout the available rolls, the dice cannot be unlocked.
Score table
ID | Points | Set | Name
01 | 000002 |  0  | Ones
02 | 000000 |  0  | Twos
03 | 000003 |  0  | Threes
04 | 000004 |  0  | Fours
05 | 000005 |  0  | Fives
06 | 000000 |  0  | Sixes
07 | 000000 |  0  | Three of a kind
08 | 000000 |  0  | Four of a kind
09 | 000000 |  0  | Straight
10 | 000000 |  0  | Full house
11 | 000000 |  0  | Yahtzee
12 | 000000 |  2  | Dice bonus!
13 | 000000 |  2  | Extra bonus!

Within the score table, you are directed to choose an ID of a score type to set.
For example, if you want to set the score for ‘Yahtzee’ (which in this example is a bad idea), you enter ‘11’ as the Yahtzee score has an ID value of 11.
When the score is set, you are unable to change it and it will contribute points to the total score. 
The score set values are similar to dice lock, false = 0 and true = 0.
If the value of a score set is 2, that means it is a bonus and will be awarded when specific goals are met.
Extra Game Mechanics:
Change non-unlockable dice amount
dice roll:   [5, 6, 5, 1, 5]
dice lock: [0, 0, 0, 0, 2]

In this example, we can see the 5th dice has a lock value of 2. This means that it cannot be unlocked throughout the available rolls.
"That's permanently locked. Press enter to try again."
If you are a daring person and choose to activate this game mechanic, you get bragging rights (that’s right, choose it).

Change maximum roll amount
This mechanic allows the player to change the amount of rolls they are allowed before being forced to choose a score.
There is no bonus, only allowing to shift towards a chance game (less than 3 rolls) or an easy game (more than 3 rolls).

 
Scoring System
Ones to Sixes – IDs 1 to 6:
Example roll: [1, 6, 5, 5, 2]
The score is the combined value of all instances of a number in the roll.
In this example, there are two fives, so on the fives score type, it will show as 10 points, because 5 times 2 equals 10.
Three of a Kind – ID 7:
Example roll: [1, 2, 3, 2, 2]
If there are 3 instances of a number in a roll, the points available will be the value of the dice times 5.
In this case, you get 12 points.
Four of a Kind – ID 8:
Example roll: [5, 3, 3, 3, 3]
If there are 4 instances of a number in a roll, the points available will be the value of the dice times 10.
In this case, it is 30 points.
Straight – ID 9:
Example roll: [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]
This occurs when the roll contains consecutive numbers.
If the roll contains numbers 1 to 5, there will be 40 points available.
If the roll contains numbers 2 to 6, there will be 60 points available.
Full House – ID 10:
Example roll: [3, 2, 3, 3, 2]
If the roll contains 3 instances of one number and 2 instances of another,
the available points will be:
8 times the value of the number with 3 instances, plus
4 times the value of the number with 2 instances.
Yahtzee – ID 11:
Example roll: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4]
If a roll contains only one number, the available points will be 15 times the value of that number.
Bonus System – IDs 12 and 13
ID | Points | Set | Name
12 | 000000 |  2  | Dice bonus!
If a score set value is 2, that means it is a bonus obtained by completing a collection of score types.
Dice bonus: an extra bonus of 50 points is awarded if all dice score types (ones to sixes) earn at least points (All the scores only need to not equal 0).
Extra bonus: a bonus of 50 points is awarded if all extra score types (e.g. three of a kind) earn at least points.
